Recently transplanted from the Pacific Northwest and into the backwoods wilds of suburban New Jersey, Mickey presses dozens of plastic buttons thousands of times each day for fun and profit.

Mickey's present obsession is _[Ghostwolf](/ghostwolf.html)_. Check out what has been revealed thus far.

**Note** that content on this site ranges somewhere between PG-13 and R. Sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll will be present. Also, swearing. And not very much drugs, actually. Or rock'n'roll. Pretty much just sex and swearing. Maybe some drinking. And the occassional ramble.

From Mickey: "I do have an employer, but they have the right to disavow me, and nothing I say can be used against them."

For shorter quips, bereft of depth, gravity and prose, take a gander <span title="If you're using a screen reader, or an oddball who reads website source code, you may find it amusing that that reads 'a gander at-at Mickey Mullin.'">at [@MickeyMullin](https://twitter.com/MickeyMullin)</span> on <a class="icon-twitter read-more" href="https://twitter.com/MickeyMullin"><span class="hidden">Twitter</span></a>&nbsp;Twitter, and his [official Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Author.Mickey.Mullin/).
